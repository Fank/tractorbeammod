Tractor Beam mod for Space Engineers

Currently this mod adds functionality for pulling and pushing objects to a certain minimum and maximum distance with a settable amount of newton force.

Planned changes are to make the pull and push force be constant speed intead of force applied, retain min and max sliders and replace newtons of force slider with a speed of attraction/repulsion slider.
